# Ideas

### Monsters
there are monsters that youy need to avoid colliding with as if you touch them you will lose HP
and if you lose all your hp you start at the begning
### Pickups
you can find items,powerups, armor, wepons, money, ect on the ground and put into a inventory sytem that hold all you items. this can most likley be stored in an array
### Walls
walls ar collidable and will block your path/movment if you collide with them. They can be used to hide from monsters or take cover and heal from combat
### Wepons
as mentioned previously you can find wepons as pickups. Wepons can break walls, damage monsters, and if they are used your character will be sent backwards a bit as a type of recoil
